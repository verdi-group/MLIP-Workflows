# mlip-workflows

MLIP command line workflows for phonons, NEB/MEP, ShakeNBreak giving vasp-improvable results (for computational efficiency) for the 6 model families supported by this package. In addition, mlip fine-tuning is supported fully for MACE and ORB model families, with petmad coming soon. The former two support LoRA and REPLAY fine tuning.

## Workflows

- `mlip-phonons --inputs <config-dir>` for phonons, DOS, and band structures
- `mlip-neb --inputs <config-dir>` for NEB / MEP runs
- `mlip-snb --inputs <config-dir>` for ShakeNBreak defect workflows
- `mlip-coup --inputs <config-dir>` for phonon-coupling analysis

Examples of [SnB](demo/snb), [NEB](demo/neb), and [Phonon](demo/phonons) workflows are included.

## Fine Tuning

Three families are included in fine-tuning. LoRA and REPLAY style fine tuning are available for MACE and ORB. Pet-mad is still running into some issues, I am yet to push that work.

## Benchmarking Supported for any MLIP-workflow

All workflows are available to be benchmarked. That is, you can download any number of supported models (list found in [SUPPORTED_MODELS.yml](SUPPORTED_MODELS.yml), but, generally, any model in the MACE, Orb, PET-MAD, Tensornet, mattersim and CHGNet model families).

If `defaults.model_name` is a list, the ordinary workflow command fans out once per model and runs each case in the model-specific environment from `SUPPORTED_MODELS.yml`. This enables you to take any workflow defined by its config.yml file, and then simply append model names to run the same workflow across however many models you like.

For the fine-tuning demos, [step 4](demo/fine_tuning/mace/4_benchmark) shows this usage, with:

- `mlip-neb --inputs demo/fine_tuning/<family>/4_benchmark --report-benchmark`


## Setup

- Put model files under `assets/models/<family>/`
- Register model environments in `SUPPORTED_MODELS.yml`

For all model families you are using, install and set up their corresponding environments according to [environments.md](docs/environments.md).

Once you do that, you are done and free to run these workflows. More details on running the workflows can be found [here](docs/workflows).

## Caveat

Dependent on CUDA.
